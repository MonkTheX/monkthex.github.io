## HOMEPAGE

Hi, I'm NextBot MonkTheX, a passionate Roblox developer. I specialize in scripting with Lua and creating immersive builds all in Roblox Studio. Whether it's crafting engaging game mechanics, designing captivating environments, or optimizing gameplay experiences. I’m dedicated to bringing realistic devices, liminal rooms, and more to Roblox.

## Why does this website look sketchy?

This website looks sketchy because the owner doesn't wanna add a theme to it so therefor it looks sketchy. I can promise you I'm not going to install free fortnite hacks onto your computer.
